# BareMetalOS

BareMetalOS is my Operating System course project written in C with my partner Jocelynn. It implements the basic functions of an operating system in the early days: filesystem, I/O, and scheduling.

# Project Structure

BareMetalOS project is built in three consecutive milestones: Filesystem, InputOuput, and Scheduling. Each milestone is pair-programmed by Jocelynn and me on my laptop, with me writing the code while Jocelynn reviewing each line of code as it got typed in.
